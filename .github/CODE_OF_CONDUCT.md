# Code of Conduct

## Our compromise

We, as members, contributors and maintainers, commit to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Be respectful and courteous to other participants
- Accept constructive criticism and provide feedback constructively
- Focus on problem solving and project advancement
- Respect differences of opinion and approaches

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Use of sexualized language or images and unwanted sexual advances or attention
- Insulting or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other people's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Any other conduct that may be considered inappropriate in a professional environment

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and must take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instance of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both in project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting on official social media, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Application

Instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. The project team is required to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Additional details of specific enforcement policies may be published separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or apply the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by other members of the project leadership.
